## ML-Based Three-Phase Fault Classification
This was my first Machine Learning project, developed as part of my journey to learn and apply ML concepts to power system applications by help of AI and YT videos.

A machine learning-based power system fault classification project that identifies different three-phase fault conditions from simulated voltage and current measurements.

The project generates synthetic data for **No Fault, Line-to-Ground (LG), Line-to-Line (LL), Double-Line-to-Ground (LLG), and Three-Phase (LLL)** conditions, with added noise and phase variations to make the dataset more realistic.

Two machine learning models, **Random Forest** and **RBF-SVM**, are trained using voltage, current, sequence-component, and unbalance features. Their performance is evaluated using **Accuracy, Macro F1-score, Classification Reports, Feature Importance, and Confusion Matrices**.

**Technologies:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
